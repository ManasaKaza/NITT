The main aim of this work is to apply different clustering techniques (KMeans, DBSCAN and HIERARCHICAL) to two different datasets of medical and business domains and analyse the
performance of the clusters generated by different algorithms. In specific:
 Data preprocessing
 Computing the number of clusters
 Plotting the clustering results
 Computing the comparison metric values and analysis.
The comparative analysis of the clustering algorithms is carried out on two
different datasets of business and medical domain which are chosen from
UCI Machine Learning Repository
  Absenteeism at work dataset
   Heart failure clinical records dataset


Conclusion:

For the Medical dataset:
DBScan has the highest Silhouette Coefficient (0.708) and Fowlkes-Mallows Score (0.724), indicating that it performs well in forming dense clusters with high similarity.
K-Means also performs reasonably well, but with fewer clusters compared to DBScan.
Hierarchical clustering has a slightly lower Silhouette Coefficient and Fowlkes-Mallows Score compared to DBScan but still performs well.

For the Business dataset:
None of the clustering techniques perform as well as they did on the Medical dataset, with lower Silhouette Coefficients and Fowlkes-Mallows Scores across the board.
DBScan again has the highest Fowlkes-Mallows Score, indicating better performance in forming clusters with meaningful relationships.
K-Means and Hierarchical clustering techniques perform similarly but with lower scores compared to DBScan.
